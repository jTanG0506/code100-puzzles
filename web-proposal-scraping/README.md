## Web proposal scraping

You get the text of Tim Berners-Lee proposal for the web (slightly abridged). What we want are the:

- longest sentence without a comma
- shortest sentence
- sentence with the most commas.

Sentences in the original file end with a full stop and a space.

The result should be sentences ending in a full stop and a linebreak. For example:

```
Longest sentence without a comma.
Shortest sentence.
Sentence, with, the, most, commas.
```
